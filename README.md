The frontend is developed using **React** to offer a dynamic and responsive user experience. It is designed to provide users with a seamless interface for creating, managing, and ranking items across diverse domains like movies, books, or even personal choices.

## Uniqueness
**Ranker** stands out due to its **gamification of the decision-making process**. Instead of simply allowing users to rank items in a list, Ranker introduces a competitive edge through tournament-style comparisons, turning a routine decision-making process into an interactive, engaging, and enjoyable experience. This gamified ranking system helps users make thoughtful decisions while having fun.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Lists:** Users can create personalized lists of items in specific categories (e.g., movies, products, etc.). Each list can have multiple criteria for ranking.
- **Interactive Ranking:** Users can assign rankings to items based on various attributes, creating a score for each item.
- **Compare Items**: The app allows users to compare items based on specific criteria.
- **Bracket Tournaments:** One of the most unique features of Ranker is the ability to create **tournament-style brackets** for items. Users can compare items head-to-head and declare a winner, adding a fun, competitive aspect to decision-making.
- **Visualization and Updates:** The application provides real-time visualization of rankings and comparisons, automatically updating scores and ranks without refreshing the page.
- **User Engagement:** The platform is designed to be engaging and user-friendly, encouraging users to interact with their lists in creative ways, like organizing tournaments or adding new comparison criteria.
